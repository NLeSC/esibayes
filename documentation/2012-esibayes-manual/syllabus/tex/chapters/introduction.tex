This document is a manual for learning how to use the LISA cluster computer hosted at SARA (\burl{http://www.sara.nl/systems/lisa}) for solving parameter tuning and system identification problems. The manual covers the basic organization of the cluster's hardware, and provides the user with some simple commands you'll need for manipulating the Linux system that LISA is running. The manual further introduces parameter tuning and system identification software that can be run on LISA. While going through this manual, you'll find that most of it is aimed at Windows users, but occasionally there will be brief instructions for Linux users as well (usually in the footnotes). It is assumed that you are proficient in using MATLAB or Octave. Furthermore, it is assumed that you have a basic understanding of some of the general concepts used in optimization.
