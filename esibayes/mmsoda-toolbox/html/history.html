The use of computer simulation models has seen a rapid increase over the last few decades. In the natural sciences, it is often the case that these models are to some extent <i>conceptual</i>, in the sense that some of their parameters cannot be measured directly, but have to be inferred through a process of trial and error, known as <i>calibration</i>. In this process, the user runs the model with different parameter values, while keeping track of how well each parameter set does according to some fitness criterion (<i>objective function</i>). When the adjustments are made by hand, this procedure can be quite labor-intensive, especially when dealing with a model that has many parameters. To avoid this, automatic calibration methods have been developed, in which a computer oversees the selection of parameter sets, with which the model is run.

Since the early works of for example <i>Dawdy and O'Donnell</i> (1965), a wide variety of automatic calibration methods has been developed. In the natural sciences, the nature of many models makes it difficult to efficiently and effectively search the parameter space. More specifically, these models often suffer from the existence of many local optima having both small and large domains of attractions and discontiunous derivatives. To overcome such problems, <i>Duan</i> et al. (1992) developed the Shuffled Complex Evolution global optimization algorithm, which was found to be consistent, efficient and effective in locating the best parameter set.
