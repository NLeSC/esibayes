  abstract = {The use of well-characterized porous media can simplify and improve
    the efficiency of laboratory subsurface flow and transport experiments.
    The objective of this study was to present a comprehensive set of
    hydrologically relevant properties for a unique set of commercially
    available silica sands. Features of sands selected for characterization
    included high sphericity, high batch-to-batch consistency, Miller-similarity,
    and availability in large quantities. Samples of four different sand
    grades (12/20, 20/30, 30/40, and 40/50 sieve sizes) were characterized
    for physical properties, chemical composition, water retention, three-phase
    air-non-aqueous-phase liquid (NAPL)-water saturation-pressure relationships
    for water and a model NAPL, Soltrol 220, and saturated and unsaturated
    hydraulic conductivity. Properties common to all sand grades included
    high chemical purity and low organic matter content. Water retention
    curves featured well-defined air entry pressures and the Miller-similarity
    of the media was demonstrated for both static and dynamic properties.
    During water retention measurements, we determined that the common
    assumption of a uniform vertical water content distribution in retention
    cells can result in significant errors in uniform porous media. A
    numerical correction procedure was developed and successfully applied
    to correct fitted water retention curve parameters, illustrating
    that potential errors of up to 70% in volumetric water content are
    made without proper analysis. The characterization data for the four
    sand grades presented here should facilitate their use in a wide
    range of laboratory flow and transport studies.},
